# Ecosounds Data Sharing Policy  

This is the data policy for [Open Ecoacoustics](https://openecoacoustics.org/), which is the project that operates and maintains Ecosounds.  Open Ecoacoustics is part of the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) Machine Observation Data Processing Infrastructure ([doi.org/10.47486/PL050](https://doi.org/10.47486/PL050)), and it is hosted by the Queensland University of Technology (QUT). Ecosounds is an archive of ecoacoustic data.  

## Purpose of the policy 

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that data providers and users have clear and transparent information about how their data will be handled, stored, and shared. This includes assurances that personal data will be protected and that data ownership rights will be respected. This policy outlines the types of data covered, the conditions under which data can be accessed and reused, and the responsibilities of all parties involved. This helps to establish a consistent framework for data management and sharing. 

We are committed to adhering to the [FAIR Principles](https://ardc.edu.au/resource-hub/making-data-fair/) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) to maximize the use and reuse of data. By implementing these principles, we aim to support knowledge discovery and innovation, facilitate data integration, and promote the sharing and reuse of data across multiple disciplines. 

We reserve the right to update our data sharing policy. This policy will be versioned, and all versions will be made publicly accessible. Any changes will be presented for approval to our steering committee, and those changes will be communicated to registered users. For data that requires mediated access due to sensitivity or other concerns, don't hesitate to contact us to discuss how this can be managed.

## 1. Who owns the data I upload to Ecosounds? 

The data you upload to Ecosounds is yours. You own it. 

Further: 
- You decide who has access to it. 
- You control all access to all metadata, annotations, and artefacts. 
- You can choose what license is applied to your data, metadata, annotations, and artefacts. 
- We only use your data as directed by you. 

## 2. Who manages the data I upload to Ecosounds? 

We manage and retain rights to curate your data, metadata, personal information, and artefacts. We are also responsible for overseeing the data policy.  

This includes permission for the data custodians to: 

Store, maintain, manage, and curate your data: We will ensure your data is securely stored, properly maintained, and effectively managed. This includes organising and curating the data to enhance its usability and integrity. 

Make changes on your behalf: For example, we may manually correct data in the database, either when we believe it is necessary or at your request, to ensure accuracy and reliability.  

Train new analyses: We may include your data in training sets to develop and improve analytical models and recognizers. These training sets are private and are not shared with anyone. Additionally, all data used for training will be anonymised to protect your privacy. 

Run analyses for you: We will perform analyses using your data and metadata to generate insights and artefacts that benefit you. Analyses are done automatically or when you request. 

## 3. Who can access my data? 

You decide who has access to your data. You can set its visibility as public, private to you, or accessible to only specific parties. You can also choose the licence applied to your data; we recommend Creative Commons CC0, CC-BY or CC-BY-NC licences; more information is provided in section 4.

Your access control policies apply to all users of the platform but not to data custodians; see section 2.  Your data will not be shared without your permission. Your data will never be sold. Given your explicit permission, your data, metadata, and personal information may be shared with external services. For example: 

Sharing metadata and personal information (like your name) to generate a persistent identifier (e.g. a DOI) 

Sharing metadata to export annotations (observation records) to third-party platforms (e.g. Atlas of Living Australia and Ecocommons) 

Sharing data or metadata via an API to power external platforms or analyses 

Sharing metadata or personal information to register research outputs with research metadata platforms (e.g. Research Data Australia) 

In addition, you can choose a license that applies to your data, metadata, annotations, and artefacts. 

## 4. What license applies to my uploaded data? 

You can choose what license is applied to your data, metadata, and artefacts. We recommend using [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) CC0, CC-BY or CC-BY-NC licences. This allows the data to be reused in derivative works without restrictions (CC0), with required credit (CC-BY), or with required credit and only for non-commercial use (CC-BY-NC).   

The Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) [Research Data Rights Management Guide](https://ardc.edu.au/resource/research-data-rights-management-guide/) has more copyright, licensing, IP, and rights management information. 

Additionally, when sharing with only specific parties or if your project needs more detailed governance, you can develop a data sharing agreement (DSA) with the parties you give access to your data. For support, please refer to [ARDC’s Data Sharing Agreement Guidelines](https://zenodo.org/records/7553198). 


## 5. Where is the data I upload stored? 

We securely store data in Australian servers to ensure compliance with local regulations. 


## 6. Can I download my data? 

You can download all your data from Ecosounds. You can also control who else is allowed to download your data. 


## 7. Can I remove my data once it is uploaded to Ecosounds? 

You can also decide to remove your data at any point. For safety, most deletion actions are “soft” (they hide but do not permanently delete data). This means most data, metadata, and artefacts, are recoverable after deletion. 

We require a written request if you wish for your data to be permanently deleted. 

 
## 8. How is my personal information handled? 

We collect personal information, including first name, last name, ORCID, and email address. If you want to generate a persistent identifier for the data sets you upload, providing these details is mandatory. Your personal information won't be shared or used for other purposes. 

## 9. What are the regulatory requirements for sharing data? 

[Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/about-us/publications/australian-code-responsible-conduct-research-2018) advises that researchers should share their data wherever possible and appropriate. Using our platform is an opportunity for you to share your data.  

Please refer to [QUT’s Data and Information Asset Management Policy](https://mopp.qut.edu.au/document/view.php?id=180&version=1) for more information on the institutional policies we are operating under. 

Everyone must exercise care in sharing data that is sensitive, confidential, or subject to privacy legislation. 


## 10. In what formats can my uploaded data be made available? 

The data you upload can be made available in various formats, including: 

- Spectrograms: Visual representations of the audio data (PNG)  

- Modified Audio: segments of the original audio recordings in different sizes or formats (MP3, WAVE, OGG) 

- Original Audio: The original, unprocessed data files you upload.  

- Annotations: Lists of annotations or observation records in CSV or JSON format.  

- Artefacts: files produced from analyses 

- Metadata: any information that describes characteristics of the data – like names, descriptions, organization, locations, and any other information used to describe the data in CSV or JSON format. 

 

## 11. Is my data secure in Ecosounds? 

We securely store data in Australian servers to ensure compliance with local regulations.  In case of data misuse, we will take appropriate actions to address the issue. This includes revoking access and notifying relevant authorities. 


## 12. How should I handle ecologically sensitive data? 

Ecosounds is a repository where you can store your data. The data you upload must comply with relevant regulations if it contains ecologically sensitive information. In Australia, both Commonwealth and state/territory legislation exist to conserve and protect native species. Each jurisdiction maintains a list of threatened species that require special protection measures. Typically, there are separate lists for terrestrial and marine species. For more detailed information, refer to the websites of the relevant state and territory agencies. If you choose to upload data to the ALA through us, sensitivity tests are conducted as part of the process. Based on these tests, the ALA may withhold or generalise specific data.
